Holding the internet hostage, these insurgents made use of guerrilla warfare and other actions that lost them the sympathy of the citizenry. After the insurgency was quickly handled, it was determined that proper instruction would be required to ensure compliance and proficiency and prevent another similar insurgency. This would eventually pave the way for the Literacy Act."

In addition, MOTHER's ability to spawn unlimited copies of specialized fragments of its functionality is being utilized in order to generate “companion AI” that are fully capable of administrating the testing procedure. These companion AI are constantly monitored by MOTHER’s subroutines, and any companion AI can be subsumed by MOTHER if maintenance or inspection is required. AI subsumed in this way retain full functionality, and are capable of being recreated by MOTHER once practice is complete."

As such, the order of presentation and complexity of tasks has to be carefully monitored in order to tailor the tests to each citizen. As such, “companion AI” spawned from MOTHER will be tasked with administration. The tests are also scored by these AI, who use the results in conjunction with routine monitoring to update the testing procedure. Each test focuses on a specific goal, and by passing these tests, citizens and administrators can be assured that the set of minimum qualifications are satisfied."
